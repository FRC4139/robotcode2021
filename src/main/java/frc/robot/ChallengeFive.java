        Instructions on how to get data from the robot:
            controller.getAngleFacing() returns a double indicating which angle (in degrees) the robot is facing
            controller.getUltraSonicReading() returns a double indicating the ultrasonic sensor reading in INCHES
            controller.getDistanceTravelled("fL") returns a double indicating the distance travelled by the front left wheel in FEET

        Instruction on how to control the robot:
            controller.setDriveSpeed(double leftSpeed, double rightSpeed) sets the speed of the right and left wheels. Only the wheels in the back will be powered. 
                                                                          The values MUST be between (0.9 and -0.9) (negative is backwards).
            controller.setIntakeSpeed(double speed) sets the speed of the intake. Values should be between (-0.9 and 0.9) 

            The shooter works in two seperate parts. 
            First, there is a big and strong wheel which actually launches the balls. This wheel must be charged up for 0.5 - 1.5 seconds before shooting.
            controller.setShooterSpeed(double speed) controls the speed of the big shooter wheel. This value should be between (0.4 and 0.9).             
            Second, there is a small, rubber wheel, which feeds the balls into the shooter.
            controller.setFeederSpeed(double speed) controls its speed. In order to feed balls, set it to -0.4 (FEEDER_SPEED). Otherwise, set it to ZERO.
