# DON'T COMMIT TO MASTER WITHOUT PERMISSION

# robotcode2021
This is the 2021 robot code - an extension of 2020's code. Please use clear and concise commits so that people can understand what you are doing.  
To download the code from GitHub Desktop, go to File > Clone Repository > FRC4139/robotcode2021. Store it in a place which you will remember.  
  
To work on the code, launch the WpiLib VSCode you installed earlier, and go to File > Open Folder and then select the robotcode2021 folder (don't double click it; click on it and then click select folder).

Please communicate with the rest of programming about any changes you make to files other than yours.  
I'm aware that there are extra files which are unused, but I'm not going to remove them quite yet.  

If you would like to work on other challenges, feel free to.   

Please ask for help if you are confused about anything.
